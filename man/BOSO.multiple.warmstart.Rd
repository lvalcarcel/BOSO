\arguments{
\item{x}{Input matrix, of dimension 'n' x 'p'. This is the data from the 
training partition. Its recommended to be class "matrix".}

\item{y}{Response variable for the training dataset. A matrix of one column 
or a vector, with 'n' elements}

\item{xval}{Input matrix, of dimension 'n' x 'p'. This is the data from the 
validation partition. Its recommended to be class "matrix".}

\item{yval}{Response variable for the validation dataset. A matrix of one 
column or a vector, with 'n' elements}

\item{nlambda}{The number of lambda values. Default is 100.}

\item{IC}{information criterion to be used. Default is 'eBIC'.}

\item{n.IC}{number of events for the information criterion.}

\item{p.IC}{number of initial variables for the  information criterion.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{Smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of 
lambda.max, the (data derived) entry value}

\item{lambda}{A user supplied lambda sequence. Typical usage is to have the 
program compute its own lambda sequence based on nlambda and 
lambda.min.ratio. Supplying a value of lambda overrides this. 
WARNING: use with care}

\item{intercept}{Boolean variable to indicate if intercept should be added 
or not. Default is false.}

\item{standardize}{Boolean variable to indicate if data should be scaled 
according to mean(x) mean(y) and sd(x) or not. Default is false.}

\item{dfmin}{Minimum number of variables to be included in the problem. The 
intercept is not included in this number. Default is 0.}

\item{dfmax}{Maximum number of variables to be included in the problem. The 
intercept is not included in this number. Default is min(p,n).}

\item{costErrorVal}{Cost of error of the validation set in the objective 
function. Default is 1. WARNING: use with care, changing this value changes 
the formulation presented in the main article.}

\item{costErrorTrain}{Cost of error of the training set in the objective 
function. Default is 0. WARNING: use with care, changing this value changes 
the formulation presented in the main article.}

\item{costVars}{Cost of new variables in the objective function. Default is 0. 
WARNING: use with care, changing this value changes the formulation 
presented in the main article.}

\item{Threads}{CPLEX parameter, number of cores that cplex is allowed to use.
Default is 0 (automatic).}

\item{timeLimit}{CPLEX parameter, time limit per problem provided to CPLEX.
Default is 1e75 (infinite time).}

\item{verbose}{print progress. Default is FALSE}

\item{TH_IC}{is the ratio over one that the information criterion must 
increase to be STOP. Default is 1e-3.}

\description{
Function to run a single block BOSO problem, generating one 
CPLEX object and re-runing it for the different K.
}
\details{
Compute the BOSO for use one block. This function calls ILOG IBM CPLEX with 
cplexAPI to solve the optimization problem.
